🚀 Mars Rover Simulation (JavaScript)

This project is a Mars Rover simulation built in JavaScript, designed to model grid-based movement, command parsing, and state management.

The rover navigates a defined plateau using a sequence of movement instructions (L, R, M), rotating and advancing while respecting boundary constraints. The system processes commands sequentially, updates orientation dynamically, and prevents the rover from moving outside the grid.

Core concepts demonstrated:

Grid-based coordinate logic

Directional state management (N, E, S, W)

Command parsing and execution flow

Input validation and edge case handling

Clean, modular JavaScript architecture

The project focuses on logical problem-solving and deterministic state transitions — simulating how real autonomous systems interpret and execute movement instructions.

This reinforced my understanding of:

Algorithmic thinking

State-driven systems

Functional decomposition

Writing predictable, testable logic
